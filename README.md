### Preventive Water Pump Failures in Tanzania

The goal of this project is to be able to accurately predict which water pumps are not working in the villages across Tanzania. By doing so, we would be able to optimize limited maintainence crew to the areas most likely to be affected. Thereby, we allow people to have continuous access to this fundamental need, water!

In the presentation folder we have:

* Water Pump: To Fix or Not to Fix! which is a powerpoint deck going over the major points of the project
* Final Project_Final.ipynb: This includes both code and write-up from data cleaning to exploration to model selection and feature engineering.
